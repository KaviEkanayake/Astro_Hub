          <h2>~ Introduction ~</h2>
          <p>Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena.As one of the founders of the discipline, James Keeler, said, Astrophysics "seeks to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space-what they are, rather than where they are."Among the subjects studied are the Sun (solar physics), other stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background.Emissions from these objects are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the properties examined include luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition. Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, astrophysicists apply concepts and methods from many disciplines of physics, including classical mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.

          <h2>~ Research ~</h2>
          <p>Astronomy, the oldest of the physical sciences, remains a frontier field of contemporary physics. Some of the exciting current problems in astrophysics include: the large-scale structure and dynamics of the universe, the formation and the dynamics of galaxies, the structure of the sun and other stars, and the enigmatic phenomena associated with black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs (such as quasars, pulsars, and x-ray sources, the mysterious gamma-ray bursts, and cataclysmic variables). Research in astrophysics requires a broad foundation of knowledge in fundamental physics, and at the same time a familiarity with astronomical data and phenomenology.One way to describe the department's diverse research activities in astrophysics is to divide them, somewhat artificially, by the wavelength of the observations, from radio waves to X-rays. This section will also describe the department's work in experimental relativity and theoretical astrophysics.</p>

          <ul><li><p>The discovery of the expanding universe by Edwin Hubble in 1929.</p></li></ul>
          <ul><li><p>The discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1964, which provided strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.</p></li></ul>
          <ul><li><p>The discovery of dark matter and dark energy in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, which helped to explain the observed large scale structure of the universe.</p></li></ul>
          <ul><li><p>The discovery of the first exoplanet, 51 Pegasi b, in 1995, which opened up the field of exoplanetary science and the search for other worlds.</p></li></ul>
          <ul><li><p>The discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which led to the development of the concept of dark energy.</p></li></ul>

          <h2>~ Theories ~</h2>
          <p>Theorists in the astrophysics division use combinations of calculations, simulations, and observations to characterize and understand astrophysical phenomena on a wide range of scales, ranging from exoplanets, black holes, and neutron stars, to the dynamics of stars and galaxies, all the way to the universe at large. Current active areas of study include cosmology, the growth and evolution of galaxies, general relativity and gravitational waves, dark matter, and exoplanets</p>
