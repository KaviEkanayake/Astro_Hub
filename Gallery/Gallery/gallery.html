They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from spiral galaxies like the Milky Way to irregular and elliptical galaxies. They are classified based on their morphology, or shape, as well as their spectral characteristics. Galaxies contain billions or even trillions of stars and are the building blocks of the universe. They play a crucial role in our understanding of cosmology and the evolution of the universe.">

It consists of eight planets, including Earth, as well as dwarf planets like Pluto, and numerous smaller objects. The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a cloud of gas and dust. Studying the solar system allows us to understand the origin and evolution of our own planet and the universe as a whole.">

    <a href="Gallery images\3.png"data-lightbox="gallery1" data title="A nebula is a cloud of gas and dust in space. These clouds can be enormous, spanning many light years in size. Nebulae are typically formed from the remnants of exploded stars or from the material that will eventually coalesce to form new stars. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, including emission, reflection, and dark nebulae. Observing and studying nebulae allows astronomers to understand the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies.">

    <a href="Gallery images\4.png"data-lightbox="gallery1" data title="A wormhole is a hypothetical passage through space-time that could potentially allow for faster-than-light travel and communication. They are predicted by some theories of general relativity and could connect distant points in the universe. Wormholes are thought to be unstable and difficult to traverse, as they may collapse or lead to other dimensions. Although there is currently no observational evidence for the existence of wormholes, they are a popular topic in science fiction and continue to be studied by theoretical physicists.">

They are equipped with advanced technology, including propulsion systems, navigation systems, and scientific instruments. Spacecraft can be classified into various categories, such as satellites, probes, rovers, and crewed spacecraft. They have played a crucial role in our understanding of the solar system and the universe, helping us to explore and study planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. The development of spacecraft has also led to many technological advances on Earth.">

He built and improved upon telescopes, enabling him to observe and document astronomical phenomena that contradicted the geocentric model of the solar system. His work also laid the foundation for modern physics, including the laws of motion and the concept of inertia. Despite facing persecution for his ideas, Galileo's impact on science and human knowledge is immeasurable.">

This field combines principles of geology and planetary science to understand the formation, evolution, and geology of these objects. Astrogeologists use data from spacecraft missions, remote sensing techniques, and laboratory analyses to study the surfaces and interiors of these bodies. The insights gained from astrogeology have helped us understand the history and potential for habitability of our solar system and beyond.">
